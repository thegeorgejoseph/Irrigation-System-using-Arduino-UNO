# Irrigation System using Arduino UNO
 A very simple implementation of irrigation system using Arduino UNO.


A basic project created using Arduino Uno as an interdisciplinary work between Computer Science and Physics department of SRMIST. The basic idea of the project is to create a model that would be useful in irrigation. The water tank is attached to a small motor which is powered by a solar battery. The arduino uno's servo arm is coded to move in a semi circular motion, thereby helping the arm water the plants over a larger area. This approach is considered highly speculatory and has not been tested in actual premises.

This repo contains the necessary code that is required to get the servo arm of the arduino up and running.
